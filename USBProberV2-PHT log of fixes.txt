Peter Teeson: 
Changes made:
1. In file BusProberSharedFunction.m replaced all occurences of _verify_noerr with
new macro __Verify_noErr as per below. Old macros no loger supported in Sierra.
See AssertMacros.h

//    verify_noerr(err = (*deviceIntf)->DeviceRequest(deviceIntf, &req));
// PHT See comments in AssertMacros.h
__Verify_noErr(err = (*deviceIntf)->DeviceRequest(deviceIntf, &req));

2. Sierra requires macOS 10.11 as minimum SDK. For Xcode 8.3.3 changed Build settings
Base SDK to Latest macOS (macOS 10.12) and Deployment Target macOS 10.12.

3. Comment out duplicates in file BusProberDevice.h
//PHT Duplicate see above - (UInt32)locationID;
//PHT Duplicate see above - (void)setLocationID:(UInt32)locationID;

4. Fixed many Warnings of type Value Conversion issue in many files.
e.g. Implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'NSInteger' (aka 'long') to 'int'
Search for //PHT 2019 VC issue to find them.

5. Fixed several deprecations
e.g. 'NSCriticalAlertStyle' is deprecated: first deprecated in macOS 10.12
Search for //PHT 2019 deprecation issue to find them.

6. Restored original KextInfoGatherer.m text and removed Previous upload comments
Also edited KextInfoGetherer to use KextManager.h instead of OSKext.h
Removed files OSKext.h OSKextLib.h, OSKextLibPrivate.h, OSReturn.h

TO DO: Figure out how to use SDK macOS 10.11 from within Xcode 8.3.3.
TO DO: i.e. use /usr/.. linked with SDK 10.11
TO DO: Maybe that way can also work for Xcode 10.9.2 also
TO DO: which is neede to compile for macOS 10.13 High Sierra

====================== Previous upload ==========================
What I did to compile USBProberV2 on Yosemite 10.10.5 & Xcode 6.4

======= Step I - try to build got 3 Errors

In http://opensource.apple.com/
OS X 10.8.5 I downloaded IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
This did not build until I found & added missing code for:

1. USBLogger.h 
It is an empty file in OS X 10.8.5 IOUSBFamily 630.4.5. USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had a USBLogger.h but there was no content.
 
Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.

2. Similarly for KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
They are both empty files in IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
but there was no content.
Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.
        !!! but see comments in Step III !!!
At this point there were no more Errors but 31 Warnings.

======= Step II - clear 31 warnings- 1 Validate 5 Klog and 25 USBPprober
***Fixed 1 Validate project settings - Update to recommended settings

***Fixed 5 Klog issues - 4 of these were deprecations for IODataQueue.
The IODataQueue.h file contained this:
"#warning "IODataQueue is deprecated due to security issues in its interfaces, 
please use IOSharedDataQueue instead"

In file KLogClient.h replacing #include <IOKit/IODataQueue> with
#include <IOKit/IOSharedDataQueue and commenting out the extra #include IODataQueue in KLogClient.cpp
eliminated the 4 warnings

The 5th warning was for InfoPlist.strings:0: 
"The specified input encoding is Western (Mac OS Roman), 
but file contents appear to be Unicode (UTF-16); 
treating as Unicode (UTF-16)."

There were 2 bad characters at the beginning of the file.
Removing them cleared the warning.

***Fixed USBProber deprecation issues.
********    There were 7 deprecations for
'NSOKButton' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSModalResponseOK instead.
in files 
KernelExtensionsController.m IORegistryController.m, USBLoggerController.m, 
BusProbeController.m, and PortStatusController.m

Replacing them with NSModalResponseOK cleared those 6 warnings

********    There were 5 deprecations for
'NSRunAlertPanel' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSAlert instead
in file USBLoggerController.m, 

See the following methods:
5 items in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender
1 item in - (BOOL)installKLogKext
1 item in - (BOOL)removeAndinstallKLogKext

Replacing them with NSAlert cleared those 7 warnings.

********    There were 6 deprecations for
'setCalendarFormat:' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10
and also 'NSCalendarDate'
in file USBLoggerController.m,

See the following methods:
NSCalendarDate
2 items in - (IBAction)MarkOutput:(id)sender
2 items in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender

setCalendarFormat
1 item in - (IBAction)MarkOutput:(id)sender
1 item in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender

Replacing them with NSDateFormatter cleared those 6 warnings

********    There was 1 deprecation for
'loadNibNamed:owner:' in file main.m

Replacing this with the NSBUndle instnce method
- loadNibNamed:owner:topLevelObjects:
cleared the warning.

********    There was this bug
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:501:// BUG PHT  Whoever wrote this forgot the call to kextload.
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:602:// BUG PHT  The next two lines copied from method installKLogKext.
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:603: err = AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges(authorizationRef,
"/sbin/kextload", 0, kextloadArgs, NULL); // PHT
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:604: if (err) return NO; // PHT

***** HOWEVER note that there are a total of 7 deprecations of AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges
which still need to be fixed.

======= Step III - Restore the function of the Kernel Extensions tab

Apple's Open Source for a number of files was missing which meant the Kernel Extensions tab didn't work.
So I restored source of the KextInfGatherer.h and KextInfoGatherer.m
In addition Apple did not Export these 4 Headers to the relevant Frameworks
OSKext.h, OSReturn.h, OSKextLib.h, and OSKextLibPrivate.h
I had to recreate them but chose to make them local headers in this project.
This introduced 3 format string errors KextInfoGatherer requiring fixup.


Usage: USB Prober --busprobe [--vendorID --productID --deviceClass --deviceSubClass --deviceProtocol --XML]
