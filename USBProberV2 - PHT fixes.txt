Peter Teeson: 
What I did to compile USBProberV2 on Yosemite 10.10.5 & Xcode 6.4

======= Step I - try to build got 3 Errors

In http://opensource.apple.com/
OS X 10.8.5 I downloaded IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
This did not build until I found & added missing code for:

1. USBLogger.h 
It is an empty file in OS X 10.8.5 IOUSBFamily 630.4.5. USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had a USBLogger.h but there was no content.
 
Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.

2. Similarly for KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
They are both empty files in IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
but there was no content.

Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.

At this point there were no more Errors but 31 Warnings.

======= Step II - clear 31 warnings- 1 Validate 5 Klog and 25 USBPprober

1 Validate project settings - Update to recommended settings

***Fixed 5 Klog issues - 4 of these were deprecations for IODataQueue.
The IODataQueue.h file contained this:
"#warning "IODataQueue is deprecated due to security issues in its interfaces, 
please use IOSharedDataQueue instead"

In file KLogClient.h replacing with IOSharedDataQueue 
and commenting out the extra #include IODataQueue in KLogClient.cpp
eliminated the 4 warnings

The 5th warning was for InfoPlist.strings:0: 
"The specified input encoding is Western (Mac OS Roman), 
but file contents appear to be Unicode (UTF-16); 
treating as Unicode (UTF-16)."

There were 2 bad characters at the beginning of the file.
Removing them cleared the warning.

***Fixed 25 USBProber deprecation issues.
There were 6 deprecations for 
'NSOKButton' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSModalResponseOK instead.
in files 
KernelExtensionsController.m IORegistryController.m, USBLoggerController.m, 
BusProbeController.m, and PortStatusController.m

Replacing them with NSModalResponseOK cleared those 6 warnings

There were 5 deprecations for
'NSRunAlertPanel' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSAlert instead
in file USBLoggerController.m, 

Replacing them with NSAlert cleared those 5 warnings



Usage: USB Prober --busprobe [--vendorID --productID --deviceClass 
--deviceSubClass --deviceProtocol --XML]
