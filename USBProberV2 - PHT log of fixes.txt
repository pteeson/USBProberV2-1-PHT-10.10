Peter Teeson: 


What I did to compile USBProberV2 on Yosemite 10.10.5 & Xcode 6.4

======= Step I - try to build got 3 Errors

In http://opensource.apple.com/
OS X 10.8.5 I downloaded IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
This did not build until I found & added missing code for:

1. USBLogger.h 
It is an empty file in OS X 10.8.5 IOUSBFamily 630.4.5. USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had a USBLogger.h but there was no content.
 
Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.

2. Similarly for KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
They are both empty files in IOUSBFamily-630.4.5 USBProberV2
Copied the contents of OS X 10.8.4 IOUSBFamily 560.4.2 USBProberV2
because the OS X 10.8.5 had KextInfoGatherer.h, KextInfoGatherer.m
but there was no content.

Also the copyright symbol on line 2 is bad viz �. Replaced with ©.

At this point there were no more Errors but 31 Warnings.

======= Step II - clear 31 warnings- 1 Validate 5 Klog and 25 USBPprober

!!!!!!TO DO 1 Validate project settings - Update to recommended settings

***Fixed 5 Klog issues - 4 of these were deprecations for IODataQueue.
The IODataQueue.h file contained this:
"#warning "IODataQueue is deprecated due to security issues in its interfaces, 
please use IOSharedDataQueue instead"

In file KLogClient.h replacing #include <IOKit/IODataQueue> with
#include <IOKit/IOSharedDataQueue and commenting out the extra #include IODataQueue in KLogClient.cpp
eliminated the 4 warnings

The 5th warning was for InfoPlist.strings:0: 
"The specified input encoding is Western (Mac OS Roman), 
but file contents appear to be Unicode (UTF-16); 
treating as Unicode (UTF-16)."

There were 2 bad characters at the beginning of the file.
Removing them cleared the warning.

***Fixed USBProber deprecation issues.
********    There were 7 deprecations for
'NSOKButton' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSModalResponseOK instead.
in files 
KernelExtensionsController.m IORegistryController.m, USBLoggerController.m, 
BusProbeController.m, and PortStatusController.m

Replacing them with NSModalResponseOK cleared those 6 warnings

********    There were 5 deprecations for
'NSRunAlertPanel' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10 - Use NSAlert instead
in file USBLoggerController.m, 

See the following methods:
5 items in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender
1 item in - (BOOL)installKLogKext
1 item in - (BOOL)removeAndinstallKLogKext

Replacing them with NSAlert cleared those 7 warnings.

********    There were 6 deprecations for
'setCalendarFormat:' is deprecated: first deprecated in OS X 10.10
and also 'NSCalendarDate'
in file USBLoggerController.m,

See the following methods:
NSCalendarDate
2 items in - (IBAction)MarkOutput:(id)sender
2 items in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender

setCalendarFormat
1 item in - (IBAction)MarkOutput:(id)sender
1 item in - (IBAction)Start:(id)sender

Replacing them with NSDateFormatter cleared those 6 warnings

********    There was 1 deprecation for
'loadNibNamed:owner:' in file main.m

Replacing this with the NSBUndle instnce method
- loadNibNamed:owner:topLevelObjects:
cleared the warning.

********    There was this bug - HOWEVER note that there are a total of 7 deprecations of AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:501:// BUG PHT  Whoever wrote this forgot the call to ketload.
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:602:// BUG PHT  The next two lines copied from method installKLogKext.
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:603: err = AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges(authorizationRef,
    "/sbin/kextload", 0, kextloadArgs, NULL); // PHT
USBProberV2-1 PHT 10.10/USBLoggerController.m:604: if (err) return NO; // PHT

Usage: USB Prober --busprobe [--vendorID --productID --deviceClass --deviceSubClass --deviceProtocol --XML]
